###Designtokens
A simplified webbased designtoken management system. It allows you to create projects. Within a project you define your designtokens. Colorpalettes can be generated through AI. Use of colorcombinations (e.g. for buttons) will be checked if the combinations is passing accessibility tests. There are several export formats to use the design tokens in your projects. When the collection is finished for a project you can synchronize it with Figma.
